## Good morning, here is Day 2 breakfast time. ##

Today I am going to reproduce the charts in Figure 1 of the same paper: 
Dawtry, R. J., Sutton, R. M., & Sibley, C. G. (2015). Why Wealthier People Think People Are Wealthier, and Why It Matters: From Social Sampling to Attitudes to Redistribution. Psychological Science, 26(9), 1389â€“1400. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797615586560

The data is available at Open Science Foundation: https://osf.io/3mftr/
I'm using the data file "1a processed.xlsx" under Study 1a. 

![](files/Large_image_Fig1.jpeg)

**Note** I was going to reproduce both charts, but ran out of time. 
I ended up focusing on Fig 1b, and will do Fig 1a tomorrow. 

The **hashtag #FUTURE** helps me find where I'd like to improve when I look back at this someday.

                  select(-Household_Income)

# note tertile 1 is lower income, tertile 3 is higher income
#FUTURE: any better way than typing out col names in select() step? starts_with()? 
#FUTURE: how to replace NA with column mean?

#below: FUTURE learn to do this without splitting into 2 tibbles and joining again
